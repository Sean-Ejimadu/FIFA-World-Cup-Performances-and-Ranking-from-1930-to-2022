**Data Source:** Kaggle

**Objectives and Findings**

**1. Building a model that predicts match outcome:**

*The model had a training accuracy of 0.9248 and a test accuracy of 0.8756, A confusion matrix was used to visualize how my model performed on my test set*

**2. To analyze the relationship between expected goal and actual goals scored and determining if expected goals is a good predictive metric:**

*There seemed to be a weak positive correlation between expected goal and actual goals scored, This was visualized using a heatmap. For home teams expected goal was not a good predictive metric having a baseline MAE(mean absolute error) of approximately "1.2" which was lower than expected goal-based prediction of approximately "1.7", on the other hand the away baseline MAE of approximately "1.2" was higher than the expected goal-based prediction MAE approximately "1" suggests that the expected goal metric is a better predictor for away team goals compared to the baseline*

**3. Investigating the influence of penalties on match outcome by comparing the wins or draws by penalty in home and away teams:**

*Comparing away win to home win and away draw to home draw it was seen that when it comes to win or draw by penalty, teams at home tends to do win more and draw less matches unlike away teams where the margin between wins and draws is'nt all that significant.*

**4. To determine which team manager (Home and Away manager) have most impact on the match outcome using win rate as performance metric:**

*When it comes to home teams, it was seen that manager "Helmut Schoen" have the most impact on the match outcome and manager "Joachim Low" have the most impact on the match outcome for away teams.*

*To analyze how each fifa ranked team ranking and points have changed over time.*

*To investigate how teams from different associations are performing in terms of average points and rankings.*

*To analyze the attendance number across different world cup years to see if there's a trend in spectator interest.*

*To determine the top scorer all in a single World Cup and if there's a pattern in the number of goals scored in each world cup.*
